Just another repository

Hello! My name is Dawn and I'm currently a middle school math teacher. I've recently started teaching block-based coding, computer science courses at my middle school. Teaching this course has really sparked my passion for coding, web and application development. I'm hard at work, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the future I hope to learn more robust coding languages like Java, Ruby, or C#.

I'm so excited to join this wonderful community of coders!
